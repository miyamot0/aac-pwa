# Lab AAC Prototype

The Lab AAC Prototype is a Progressive Web App (PWA) tool used to support flexible development and research related to Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems. It is presented as a prototype, and it is intended to be used as a starting point for further development and research.

## Present State

The Lab AAC Prototype is currently in very, very early stages of development. It is a prototype, and it is not intended for production use. The prototype is being developed as part of a research project at Louisiana State University related to supporting simultaneous bilingual practices.
