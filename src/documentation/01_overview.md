## Overview of AAC Program

This app is a prototype for an AAC system that allows for evaluating simultaneous bilingual communication training practices. It should be considered an _experimental_ tool that is currently undergoing evaluation.

**It is not recommended for broad consumption or general clinical applications at this time**.

### Current State of the Program

The program is currently undergoing active development and is subject to change at any given time. Specifically, the program is continuously evolving as the research team iterates on the design and functionality of the program. Given that many changes are likely to occur, often without notice, the program is not considered 'stable' at this time. For this reason, it is not recommended for general clinical usage.

**Future 'stable' versions of the program may be ready for clinical purposes; however, there are not builds meeting stable criteria at this time.**

### Intended Usage for the Program

This app is intended to be used to support communication training protocols, primarily based on Functional Communication Training (FCT) practices. Specifically, this program is designed to support more than one type of language output (i.e., Language 1 [L1], Language 2 [L2]) when there is a common functional purpose (e.g., L1 and L2 represent a common request that differences only in linguistic form).

In general practice, L1 is likely to take the form of either the majority (e.g., English) or heritage language of the language learner, while L2 is likely to take the form of a secondary language (e.g., Spanish). The program is designed to support the use of multiple languages in a single interface to support the language learner in developing communication skills across multiple languages.

#### Navigating between Language Modes (L1, L2)

The program primarily works by switching between multiple **Language Modes** (i.e., L1 mode or L2 mode). The program allows for a therapist to easily switch between multiple language modes by toggling between them in the menu bar of the application.

In the future, it is planned to allow the learner with option to switch between language modes; however, this feature is not currently available. This is presently something that will be developed and refined based on individual-level basic research.

At present, the ability to switch settings (e.g., language mode) is restricted to when the AAC program is in the _board editing_ mode. The _board editing_ mode is a mode that allows for a therapist to configure the settings of the program, add/remove/edit icons on the board, and modify the language mode (e., L1 or L2).

#### Toggling Board Mode (Editing, Active)

The program, regardless of _language mode_, provides two types of interfaces that correspond with the **Board Mode** (i.e., Editing, Active).

The **Active** mode is the interface traditionally associated with usage by the language learner. This interface allows for _selecting_ icons (i.e., loading them into the sentence frame) and choosing when to emit the language associated with each icon. This simplified interface does not allow for any editing of settings and can be toggled by selecting the "Lock" icon located in the upper right area of the board screen. Once the board is locked, the learner can interact with the board as intended, and the board will remain "Locked" until the the mode is toggled by entering the password (Default password = 118).

The **Editing** mode is the interface designed to support the therapist in configuring settings to best support the language learner. When in this mode, options for editing the current board will be displayed in the menu bar of the board screen or through interacting with specific icons. In this mode, the therapist can add/edit/remove icons as well as edit settings associated with program usage (see Specific Documentation Page). The board can be "Locked" for learner use by selecting the "Lock" icon located in the upper right area of the board screen.
