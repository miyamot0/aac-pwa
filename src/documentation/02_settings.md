## General AAC Program Settings

The program supports a range of various settings to assist with examining which arrangement most supports the language learner. These settings are likely to be most useful for the _earliest learners_; however, many options are available for assisting in evaluating the usefulness of any specific setting. Formal evaluation and data-collection is suggested in this process.

A brief overview of the settings is provided below:

### Post-Speech Output Behavior

This option refers to the behavior of the board after a speech utterance is emitted. Specifically, the text loaded into the sentence frame (i.e., queue) can be cleared after a message is emitted. This may be useful in simplyfing the process of constructing a new message after a previous message is emitted.

#### Option: None (Default Behavior)

The 'none' setting, which is the default, means that there are _no changes_ made to the board after a speech utterance is emitted. That is, after the speech is emitted, the board and sentence frame will remain as they were before. Should the language learner wish to speak a different utterance in the future, they would have to manually empty the sentence frame before loading a new message (i.e., press the 'back' or delete button).

#### Option: Reset after Speech

The reset option allows the program to proactively empty the sentence frame after a message is emitted. For instance, if a sequence of icons are loaded and a message is sent, the frame would be cleared for a different sentence immediately following the emission of the message.

This may or may not be convenient for the language learner and should be considered based on the learner's needs and the level of response being performed.

### Icon Positioning Behavior

The icon positioning settings refer to how and where specific icons are positioned in the field. By default, icons have a fixed position that can be manually edited in the icon edit interface. However, for certain learners, it may be useful to adjust the positioning of icons in the field to support learning (i.e., to encourage scanning of the visual field).

#### Option: No Changes (Default)

The no changes setting is the default setting. If selected, there will be no movement of icons unless specifically and manually performed by the therapist. This is probably the easiest option if the learner reliably scans the field and does not demonstrate a bias for icons at a specific location.

#### Option: Shuffle Icon Positions

The shuffle position setting will randomly shuffle the positioning of icons in the field after each speech emission. This is often useful for learners who may demonstrate a side or location bias and/or a limit ability to scan the present field.

This may or may not be useful at all points in a learner's programming and should be formally evaluated to determine which arrangement most supports learning at the time.

### Limiting Length of Response Restrictions

There is occasionally a need to program support for a certain level of linguistic complexity (e.g., length of utterances). Settings in this area allow for targeting a certain complexity of responding, which is especially relevant for the earliest of language learners.

#### Option: No Restrictions (Default)

In this setting, the default, there no restrictions on the _length_ of the speech output queue. Specifically, the user is free to construct a response at any level of complexity (i.e., length). This is probably the most sensible default unless there is a specific need to limit the length of responses (e.g., learner will press load the queue with large queue of repetitive responses).

#### Option: Limit to Length of One

The limit to one setting simply adjusts the program functionality to limit adding icons to the sentence frame. Specifically, were there to have an icon already loaded into the sentence frame, any subsequent icon presses would be loaded into the sentence frame. This is useful for learners who may be learning to construct simple, single-word utterances, or may otherwise become distracted when they have the option to repeatedly emit the same vocal utterance in a repetitive fashion.

### Interface Verbosity

This setting is primarily designed for the benefit of the therapist and user. Specifically, the verbosity setting allows for the therapist to adjust the amount of information displayed on the screen at any given time.

This may be useful for learners who may be overwhelmed or bothered by the amount and frequency of information displayed on the screen at any given time.

#### Option: Display All Information (Default)

The display all information setting is the default setting. This setting allows for all information to be displayed on the screen at any given time. This includes the sentence frame, the icon field, and any additional information that may be displayed on the screen.

#### Option: Display Minimal Information

The display minimal information setting allows for only the most essential information to be displayed on the screen at any given time. This may include only the sentence frame and the icon field, with all other information being hidden from view. This is probably most useful for advance therapists and learners who may not benefit from repetitive app feedback (e.g., no tooltips, abbreviated messages).

### Language Setting Color Masking

The language setting color masking refers to the ability to mask the color of the language mode (i.e., L1 vs L2). This may be useful for learners when attempted to fade out the 'hints' regarding present linguistic context. For example, it may be useful to mask the color of the language mode to support the learner in developing a more robust understanding of which language best matches context (e.g., they may come to rely on program colors rather than the behavior a communication partner).

#### Option: Color Code L1/L2 (Default)

The color code L1/L2 setting is the default setting. This setting allows for the language mode to be color coded (e.g., L1 = Blue, L2 = Red). This is probably the most useful setting for the earliest learners who may benefit from the color coding to support understanding of the language mode. It is often useful for the therapist in easily understanding the current language output mode.

#### Option: Mask Language Mode

The mask language mode setting allows for the language mode to be masked. Specifically, the color of the language mode will be hidden from view. This is useful for learners who may be relying on the color of the language mode to determine which language mode is currently active. This setting may be useful for learners who are developing a more robust understanding of the language mode and may not need the color coding to support understanding.

Even if the color is masked, the language mode can still be determined by text provided on the screen (e.g., "Language 1" or "Language 2").
