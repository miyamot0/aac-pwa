## Instructions for Image Import

The program, as currently designed, minimizes complexity by not providing any built-in image assets. This allows for a more lightweight program as well as circumvents challenges associated with copyright and licensing. The program provides basic functionality for importing images via the camera on a mobile device (i.e., tablet).

### Navigating the Image Asset Gallery

The Asset Gallery is the location where all images are stored for use in the program. This gallery is accessible via the "Asset Gallery" button located in the Icon Editor screen. The gallery will display all images that have been imported into the program. Images can be selected, specific to the language context, by using the respective sections included on the Icon Editor page.

### Capturing an Image

The program allows for capturing images using the camera on a mobile device. This is especially useful for therapists who wish to include images that are relevant to the learner's environment or personal interests. The following steps outline how to capture an image for use in the program.

-   Navigate to the Icon Editor screen
-   Select the Icon Image field on either the L1 or L2 side
-   Select "Capture New Image" from the menu bar
-   On the "Capture New Image" screen, press the "Capture Image from Camera" button
-   If the image is acceptable, press the "Save to Asset Gallery" button
-   Repeat as Necessary

### Selecting an Image

Selecting an image from the Asset Gallery is a simple process. Images are selected simply by clicking or touching the respective image in the gallery. Once an image is selected, it will be saved to the icon database in the respective language context (L1 or L2). Once returning to the Icon Editor page, the image will be displayed in the Icon Image field.

### Deleting an Image

Images can be deleted from the Asset Gallery by selecting the "Delete" button located on the image in the gallery. This will remove the image from the gallery and any icons that are associated with the image. This action is irreversible, so it is recommended to only delete images that are no longer needed.

As a general note, the software does not compress images, and for this reason, it is recommended to only keep as many images as are necessary for the program. This will help to ensure that the program runs smoothly and that the gallery is not cluttered with unnecessary images.
