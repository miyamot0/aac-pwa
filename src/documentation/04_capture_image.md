## Options for Importing Images

The AAC program provides a flexible approach for importing images to use in the program. This includes the ability to capture images using the camera on a mobile device or importing images from the device's photo library. This allows for therapists and caregivers to create custom icons that are relevant to the learner's environment or personal interests.

The following sections outline how to import and use images using these methods.

### Accessing the Image Asset Gallery

The **Image Asset Gallery** represents the location where all images available for use in the program are stored. Images must be manually imported into the program before they can be used in the **Icon Editor**. Therapists can access the Asset Gallery by selecting the "Icon Image" field on either the L1 or L2 side of the Icon Editor screen. This will open the Asset Gallery, where therapists can select images to use in the program.

### Options for Importing Image Assets

Images can be imported into the program using two methods: capturing an image using the device's camera or selecting an image from the device's photo library. Generally, it is often easiest to capture images as necessary using the device's camera. However, therapists may also wish to import images from the device's photo library if they have images that are already available on the device (or if using a standard icon set for a study protocol).

The following sections outline how to import images using these methods.

#### Importing Images via Camera

The program allows for capturing images using the camera on a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet device (this works differently if on a traditional laptop or computer). The following steps outline how to capture an image for use in the program.

-   Navigate to the **Icon Editor** screen
-   Select the **Icon Image** field on either the L1 or L2 side
-   In the "Image Asset Gallery", select **Capture New Image** from the menu bar (upper right corner)
-   On the "Capture New Image" screen, press the "Capture Image from Camera" button
-   If the image is acceptable, press the "Save to Asset Gallery" button
-   Repeat as Necessary
-   Return to the "Image Asset Gallery" to select the image for use in the program

### Assigning an Image to an Icon (L1 or L2)

Selecting an image from the Asset Gallery is a simple process. Once relevant images are imported into the program, the images available to be assigned to an icon will be displayed in the **Image Asset Gallery**.

Images are selected in this screen will be assigned to the relevant icon by clicking or tapping the respective image in the gallery. Once an image is selected, it will be saved to the icon database in the respective language context (i.e., L1 or L2).

Once returning to the Icon Editor page, the image will be displayed in the Icon Image field. This may be changed at any time by following the same process and selecting a different image from the Asset Gallery.

### Deleting an Image from the Asset Gallery

Images can be deleted from the **Asset Gallery** by selecting the "Delete" button located on the image in the gallery. This will remove the image from the gallery; However, any icons that use this image will retain a cached copy of the image. The images used in each icon will require re-assignment to make the relevant changes. Removing an icon from the gallery is irreversible, though no images are ever deleted from your device's storage. You may re-import the image at any time so long as you do not remove them physically.

As a general note, the software does not compress images, and for this reason, it is recommended to only keep as many images as are necessary for the program. This will help to ensure that the program runs smoothly and that the gallery is not cluttered with unnecessary images.
