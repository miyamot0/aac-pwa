## Instructions for Audio Import

The program is designed to make no assumptions about the language or dialect of the learner. For this reason, the program does not include any built-in audio assets and initially operates using only built-in text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. This allows for a more lightweight program as well as circumvents challenges associated with copyright and licensing.

The program provides significant flexibility for therapists to customize the speech output for each icon via custom audio recordings. In this manner, the family may be included in selecting relevant speech output for the icon and tailoring output to the relevant linguistic contexts.

The program provides basic functionality for importing audio files via the microphone on a mobile device (i.e., tablet).

### Navigating the Audio Asset Gallery

The Audio Asset Gallery is the location where all _saved_ audio files are stored for use in the program. This gallery is accessible by pressing the "Select" button from the respective language context (L1 or L2) on the Icon Editor screen. The gallery will display all audio files that have been imported into the program. These audio files can be selected by clicking or touching the respective audio file in the gallery.

### Capturing an Audio Recording

The program allows for capturing audio recordings using the microphone on a mobile device. This is especially useful for therapists who wish to include audio recordings that are relevant to the learner's environment or personal interests (e.g., recording a sibling's voice). The following steps outline how to capture an audio recording for use in the program.

-   Navigate to the Icon Editor screen
-   Press the "Select" button on the L1 or L2 side of the screen
-   Select "Capture New Audio" from the menu bar
-   On the "Capture New Audio" screen, press the "Begin Recording" button
-   If the recorded audio is acceptable, press the "Save to Asset Gallery" button
-   Repeat as Necessary

### Selecting an Audio Recording

Selecting an audio recording from the Audio Asset Gallery is a simple process. Audio recordings are selected by pressing the "Select Audio" button from the respective file in the gallery. Once an audio recording is selected, it will be saved to the icon database in the respective language context (L1 or L2). Once returning to the Icon Editor page, the audio recording will be displayed in the Audio field.

### Deleting an Audio Recording

Audio recordings can be deleted from the Asset Gallery by selecting the "Delete Recording" button located on the audio file in the gallery. This will remove the audio file from the gallery and any icons that are associated with the audio file. This action is irreversible, so it is recommended to only delete audio files that are no longer needed.

As a general note, the software does not compress recordings, and for this reason, it is recommended to only keep as many recordings as are necessary for the program. This will help to ensure that the program runs smoothly and that the gallery is not cluttered with unnecessary recordings.
