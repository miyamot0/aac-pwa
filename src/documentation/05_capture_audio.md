## Options for Importing Audio

The design of the AAC program make no assumptions about the language or dialect of the learner. For this reason, the program does not include any built-in audio assets and initially operates using only built-in text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. This allows for a more lightweight program as well as circumvents challenges associated with copyright and licensing.

The program provides significant flexibility for therapists to customize the speech output for each icon via custom audio recordings (e.g., multiple language types). In this manner, the family may be included in selecting relevant speech output for the icon and tailoring output to the relevant linguistic contexts (e.g., recording culturally relevant audio from age-/gender-appropriate individuals).

The program provides basic functionality for recording audio from the microphones provided by mobile devices (e.g., tablet devices).

### Accessing the Audio Asset Gallery

The **Audio Asset Gallery** is the location where all _saved_ audio files are stored. This gallery is accessible by pressing the "Select" button from the respective language context (L1 or L2) on the **Icon Editor** screen. The Audio Asset Gallery will display all audio files that have been imported into the program. These audio files can be selected by clicking or touching the respective audio file in the gallery.

### Options for Importing Audio Assets

The program allows for capturing audio recordings using the microphone on a mobile device. This is especially useful for therapists who wish to include audio recordings that are relevant to the learner's environment or personal interests (e.g., recording a sibling's voice). The following steps outline how to capture an audio recording for use in the program.

-   Navigate to the **Icon Editor** screen
-   Press the "Select" button on the L1 or L2 side of the editor
-   In the "Audio Asset Gallery", selected "Capture New Audio" from the menu bar (upper right corner)
-   On the "Capture New Audio" screen, press the "Begin Recording" button
-   If the recorded audio is acceptable, press the "Save to Asset Gallery" button
-   Repeat as Necessary
-   Return to the "Audio Asset Gallery" to select the desired audio recording

### Assigning an Audio Recording to an Icon (L1 or L2)

Selecting an audio recording from the **Audio Asset Gallery** is a simple process. Audio recordings are selected by pressing the "Select Audio" button from the respective file in the gallery. Once an audio recording is selected, it will be saved to the icon database in the respective language context (L1 or L2). Once returning to the Icon Editor page, the audio recording will be displayed in the Audio field.

### Deleting an Audio Recording from the Asset Gallery

Audio recordings can be deleted from the Asset Gallery by selecting the "Delete Recording" button located on the audio file in the gallery. This will remove the audio file from the gallery and any icons that are associated with the audio file. This action is irreversible, so it is recommended to only delete audio files that are no longer needed.

As a general note, the software does not compress recordings, and for this reason, it is recommended to only keep as many recordings as are necessary for the program. This will help to ensure that the program runs smoothly and that the gallery is not cluttered with unnecessary recordings.

### Labeling and Organizing Audio Assets

The program allows for audio assets to be labeled and organized in a manner that is meaningful to the therapist. This can be especially useful when working with multiple learners or when creating custom audio recordings for specific contexts (e.g., a certain utterance and the corresponding language). Audio assets can be labeled with relevant information (e.g., context, date) and organized for easy access.
