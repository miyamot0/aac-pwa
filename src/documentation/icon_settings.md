## Overview of Icon Settings

The AAC program provides a range of various options for customizing the interface and behavior of the speech-generating functionality. Individual icons, for each language context (L1/L2), include a range of options related to image and speech settings. Certain icon settings apply regardless of language context (i.e., for both L1 and L2) whereas others are specific to language context (e.g., hide an icon only in the L2 context). Both shared and language-specific settings are outlined below.

### Shared Icon Settings

Shared icon settings persist across both L1/L2 contexts. As a working default, each icon reflects a singular meaning, which varies across language contexts. That is, each icon has an "L1 mode" and an "L2 mode", and the overall instance occupies the 'slot' in the visual field.

The available shared settings are outlined below.

#### Icon Index

The icon index corresponds to _where_ an icon is positioned in the field. Specifically, the index is the (base 0) position of the icon in the pre-determined grid. New icons are added at the bottom-most index, though the position of icons can be changed manually (or shuffled randomly, after each trial). The Icon index represents the position in the grid, which can be edited in the Icon Editor screen, while increments from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

### Language-specific Settings (L1 or L2)

Most settings in the Icon Editor screen are specific to language context. For example, therapists may way the flexibility to introduce new icons but not necessary in both languages at the same time. This may take the form of adding a _new_ icon but 'Hiding' the icon in one of the two language contexts.

The available language-specific settings are outlined below.

#### Icon Hide Setting

Therapists have flexibility in decide which icons remain visible in each language context. For example, should a therapist wish to follow a _sequential_ bilingual approach, they can add an icon to the field but choose to temporarily hide the icon in the later (L2) language context. Likewise, a therapist may wish to hide an icon in _both_ L1 and L2 contexts and only introduce them once the learner has demonstrated a certain level of mastery.

These settings are easily toggled in the Icon Editor screen by operating the relevant 'switch' for each language context.

#### Icon Label Setting

Each icon has a label that is displayed when the icon is pressed. This label can be customized for each language context. For example, the icon for "ball" may be labeled "ball" in the L1 context and "pelota" in the L2 context. This setting is easily adjusted in the Icon Editor screen.

Additionally, the label featured in each language context will be what is 'read' by the text-to-speech functionality when the icon is 'spoken' in the frame. Specifically, the text in the L1 would be emitted as English (i.e., in an English-speaking voice) whereas the text in the L2 would be emitted in the Spanish language (e.g., in a Spanish-speaking voice). This is the default setting unless the therapist has chosen to customize the speech settings for a specific icon (i.e., custom-recorded voice).

#### Icon Image Setting

Each icon has an image that is displayed in the respective slot. This image can be of anything; however, it is generally recommended that the image be a clear representation of the icon's meaning. That is, the picture should be easily recognizable by the learner. Pictures are easily captured using the camera included with mobile devices (i.e., tablets).

A picture can be added to an icon by selecting the 'camera' icon in the Icon Editor screen. The "Asset Gallery" contains the saved images that can be used for the icon and users can add additional pictures to the gallery by capturing new images. This is covered in another, later section.

It is recommended that, at first, therapists include visual information that assists with discriminating between the relevant lingustic context. For example, a picture of a "ball" can be taken atop a red surface to represent the L1 context and a blue surface to represent the L2 context. This is especially useful for learners who may have difficulty initially distinguishing between the two language output settings.

#### Custom Icon Audio Recording

The speech-generating functionality provided by most AAC programs is based on a text-to-speech engine. This engine is capable of producing speech output in a range of languages and voices. However, this output is neither naturally sounding nor customized to specific cultures and dialects (e.g., different versions of the English or Spanish language). For this reason, therapists may wish to customize the speech output for a specific icon.

This can be done by recording a custom audio file for the icon. In this manner, the family may be included in selecting relevant speech output for the icon.
