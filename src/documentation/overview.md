## Overview of AAC Program

This PWA is a prototype for evaluating simultaneous bilingual communication training practices. It should be considered an *experimental* tool that is currently undergoing evaluation.

It is not recommended for broad consumption or general clinical applications at this time.

### State of AAC Program

The program is currently undergoing active development and is subject to change at any given time. For this reason, it is not recommended for general clinical usage.

Future 'stable' versions of the program may be ready for clinical purposes; however, there are not builds meeting stable criteria at this time.

### Intended Usage

This PWA is intended to be used to support communication training protocols based on Functional Communication Training (FCT). Specifically, this program is designed to support more than one type of language output (i.e., L1, L2). Specifically, L1 may take the form of a majority language (English) and L2 a non-majority language (Spanish).

#### Language Modes (L1, L2)

The program works by switching between multiple **Language Mode** (i.e., L1 mode or L2 mode). The program allows for a therapist to easily switch between multiple language modes by toggling between them in the menu bar of the application.

As an effort to reduce complexity on the language learner, the ability to switch settings (e.g., language mode) is restricted to when the program is in *board editing* mode.

#### Board Modes (Editing, Active)

The program, regardless of *language mode*, provides two types of interfaces that correspond with the **Board Mode** (i.e., Editing, Active).

The *Active* mode is the interface traditionally associated with usage by the language learner. This interface allows for *selecting* icons (i.e., loading them into the sentence frame) and choosing when to emit the language associated with each icon. This simplified interface does not allow for any editing of settings and can be toggled by selecting the "Lock" icon located in the upper right area of the board screen.

The *Editing* mode is the interface designed to support the therapist in configuring settings to best support the language learner. When in this mode, options for editing the current board will be displayed in the menu bar of the board screen. In this mode, the therapist can add/edit/remove icons as well as edit settings associated with program usage (see Specific Documentation Page).
