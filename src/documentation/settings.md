## Board Settings

The program supports a range of various settings to assist with examining which arrangement most supports the language learner. Generally, these settings are likely to be most useful for the earliest learners, and evaluating the usefulness of any specific setting is suggested.

### Post-Speech Emission Settings

Various Post-speech settings are provided to assist with early teaching of individual responses. These are useful insofar as they help arrange and present learning trials that can be more difficult to facilitate when technology does not provide an option for automation.

#### None (Default)

The none setting, the default, means that there are no changes made to the board after a speech utterance is emitted. That is, after the speech utterance is emitted, the board and sentence frame will remain as they were before. Should the language learner wish to speak a different utterance in the future, they would have to manually empty the sentence frame before loading a new message.

#### Reset after Speech

The reset option allows the program to proactively empty the sentence frame after a message is emitted. For instance, if a sequence of icons are loaded and a message is sent, the frame would be cleared for a different sentence immediately following the emission of the message.

This may or may not be convenient for the language learner and should be considered based on the learner's needs and the level of response being performed.

### Icon Positioning Behavior

The icon positioning settings refer to how and where specific icons are positioned in the field. By default, icons have a fixed position that can be manually edited in the icon edit interface.

#### No Changes (Default)

The no changes setting is the default setting. If selected, there will be no movement of icons unless specifically and manually performed by the therapist.

#### Shuffle Positions

The shuffle position setting will randomly shuffle the positioning of icons in the field after each speech emission. This is often useful for learners who may demonstrate a side or location bias and/or a limit ability to scan the present field.

This may or may not be useful at all points in a learner's programming and should be formally evaluated to determine which arrangement most supports learning at the time.

### Length of Response Restrictions

There is often a need to program support for a certain level of linguistic complexity (e.g., length of utterances). Settings in this area allow for targeting a certain complexity of responding, which is especially relevant for the earliest of language learners.

#### No Restrictions (Default)

There no restrictions setting represents the default behavior for the program. Specifically, the user is free to construct a response at any level of complexity (i.e., length).

#### Limit to Length of One

The limit to one setting simply adjusts the program functionality to limit adding icons to the sentence frame. Specifically, were there to have an icon already loaded into the sentence frame, any subsequent icon presses would be loaded into the sentence frame.
